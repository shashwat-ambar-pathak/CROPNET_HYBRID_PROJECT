# 🌱 CropNet-Hybrid: Deep Learning Model for Crop Disease Detection

## 📌 Overview
**CropNet-Hybrid** is a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based hybrid model designed for **crop disease detection and classification**.  
It has been trained on the **PlantVillage dataset**, covering **38 different crop–disease classes** across multiple plant species.  

This project integrates **Machine Learning, FastAPI, and React** to build a real-time **Crop Disease Detection Web Application**.  
The goal is to empower farmers and researchers with an intelligent tool to detect diseases early and protect crops effectively.
